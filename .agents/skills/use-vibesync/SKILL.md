# Use VibeSync

Speak `CONTEXT.md`'s vocabulary throughout, with no synonyms: Folder pair, Pair name, Mirror, Update, SafetyNet, Run folder, Prune, Journal, Run id, Dry-run, Compare, Publish, Convergence, Verification, Expected degradation, Run preconditions.

## Binary invocation

Prefer the `vibesync` binary on `PATH`. Where it is not installed, fall back to `cargo run --locked --`, matching `AGENTS.md`'s build workflow — append the same arguments after the `--`.

## Design context — refer, don't restate

This skill assumes `CONTEXT.md` and the ADRs below; consult them rather than restating their content here:

- `docs/adr/0002-run-preconditions.md` — abort-by-default Run preconditions: mount state, volume identity, free space.
- `docs/adr/0003-dryrun-diff-and-review.md` — review-first Dry-run/Run and the human/NDJSON diff shape.
- `docs/adr/0004-cli-surface.md` — command grammar and exit-code taxonomy.
- `docs/adr/0007-journal-design.md` — the Journal as forensic record, not resume authority.
- `docs/adr/0008-post-copy-verification.md` — the per-file Verification gate.
- `docs/adr/0010-commander-two-sided-review.md` — the TUI's two-sided action table.
- `docs/adr/0011-scripted-tui-input-synchronisation.md` — scripted TUI input rendezvous.

## Pair list — direct, ungated, read-only

`pair list` never mutates the destination, so it runs immediately: no review, no confirmation gate.

- Real binary: `vibesync pair list`
- Development fallback: `cargo run --locked -- pair list`

Report back the Folder pairs it returns.
